                    <p>
                        Tic Tac Toe is a simple strategy game played on a 3x3 grid. Two players, X and O, take turns
                        marking
                        spaces, aiming to align three symbols in a row. It teaches quick decision-making and logical
                        thinking. The game often ends in a draw if both players play perfectly, making it a fun yet
                        challenging way to sharpen minds and enjoy competition.
